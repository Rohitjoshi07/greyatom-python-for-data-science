### Project Overview

 This project is a type of message decoder using python data structures, functions, operators, conditionals, loops, and covering all the basic program flow in python.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project all my basics on python program flow like DS, loops, conditional, comprehension, operators, functions, etc are clear.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 While solving this project I took a step=wise approach towards the problem which helps me to divide the problem into steps and make it easier to code for each step. Finally combining all the steps results in the final code which solved the problem statement given. 


### Challenges faced

 Some tricky challenges that I faced in this project are with list comprehension and string formatting techniques, but I overcome them by trying and approaching different methods/techniques towards the problems. 


### Additional pointers

 This project clears all the basic knowledge in python program overflow and helps to memorize and practice all the basic overflow of python.
